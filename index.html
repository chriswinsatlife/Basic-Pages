<p class="p1">PART FOUR</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Use Incentives to Identify the Problem</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A man goes in to consult his doctor regarding his wife of thirty-seven years. “You see, doctor, I’m worried. I think my wife is developing hearing problems,” he says. “But I don’t know how to approach her and recommend that she gets checked. Any suggestions on how to do it without upsetting her?” His doctor calms him down, telling him it’s often the case that hearing deteriorates with age. He suggests a simple test he can do with his wife. “Next time the two of you are together, and she has her back to you, call her from the other side of the room in a low voice. If she doesn’t hear you, get a couple of feet closer to her and try again. If this doesn’t work, try getting even closer to her.” The man waits for the first chance to follow his doctor’s suggestion. That evening, he sees his wife sitting on the living room sofa. He calls her from the other end of the room in a low voice. “Jane?” No reaction. He’s now even more worried and gets closer to her, whispering, “Jane?” Again, no reaction. So he gets even closer and tries again: “Jane?” His wife turns to him and says, “For the third time, what?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This old joke has always been both funny and insightful to me. The man was fundamentally wrong in his diagnosis of the problem. Oftentimes, so are the people who study human behavior. It’s humbling, to say the least. Like the man in the joke, economists and psychologists in my field often think “people” are the source of a problem, when in reality, it’s us. We regularly decide that people make mistakes, calling it “irrational” behavior (which is just a fancy scientific way of saying “stupid”). However, it is often the researcher who makes the mistake by not understanding the underlying reasons behind a behavior.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Such misdiagnoses are not unique to social scientists. They happen often in the medical field—more than one would like to think. In the US, approximately twelve million people who seek outpatient medical care are misdiagnosed each year.1 That’s one out of every twenty patients! When the misdiagnosis is corrected quickly, no harm, no foul. When it’s not, it has the potential to result in severe injury, both physically and financially. After all, in order to effectively treat a disease, the doctor needs first to know what it is—hence the procedural battery of tests such as scans and blood draws. These do not directly cure the patient but rather help to diagnose the problem. Then, and only then, can a doctor begin treatment. If the problem is diagnosed incorrectly from the get-go, the doctor will treat the wrong problem.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">What’s the problem? Depends on who’s asking</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Much of the work I’ve discussed with you thus far has involved using incentives as a solution to a problem. Incentives can also be used to help diagnose a problem from early on, much like blood tests can help diagnose a disease. When companies or governments try to solve the wrong problem, you can imagine the consequences that could reverberate not only financially but also socially through changed policies that may not be appropriate or effective.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Solving the wrong problem could also be the result of a wrong perspective (see the deer in the figure).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This part of the book uses four examples to discuss how incentives can be used to better understand why people do what they do. Use incentives from the start to correctly diagnose the problem, and then you can begin to work toward a solution.</p>

<p class="p1">Chapter 13</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Are US Students Really So Bad?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Monday morning, 8 a.m. Fifteen-year-old Tyler strolls into his tenth-grade class to see thirty desks with closed packets set on top of them. His yawn turns into a groan. This can’t be good. Walking over to the back row, he plops himself down into the hard plastic seat and slouches, waiting for everyone else to trickle in. He sees Mr. Grossman at the chalkboard, writing “Start Time” and “End Time,” but Tyler holds onto the hope that it’s not what he thinks. No such luck. As soon as the last student arrives, Mr. Grossman announces that their school had been randomly selected to participate in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The test will take three hours. But then, Tyler learns that the results will not affect his grades at all. No one he cares about will ever know about his performance on the test. He will not get his score back, and neither will his parents nor his school. Mr. Grossman starts the clock. Let’s get this over with, Tyler thinks.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Tyler’s done long before the three-hour mark. After all, he has absolutely no incentive to want to take this test or to do well on it. He’s fifteen—the US national ranking on standardized tests means next to nothing to him. He’s zoned out by the time you get to the word “rankings.” Tyler’s apathy toward the PISA is probably shared by many of his peers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nonetheless, so much weight is put onto these standardized tests in the field of education. They’re regarded as an accurate measurement of student learning. Policy makers are increasingly interested in using student assessments as a way to evaluate the success of the education system. The fact that students in the US perform so poorly on them has been a concern for many years now.1</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The PISA is a triennial international survey conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which aims to evaluate education systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of fifteen-year-old students.2 More than half a million students in seventy-two countries take the test, which assesses knowledge in science, mathematics, reading, collaborative problem solving, and financial literacy.3</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Like the US, many countries shape parts of their education policy decisions on the basis of the results of standardized tests. As we discussed before, Finland, for instance, performed unexpectedly well on the 2000 PISA; analysts have noted that its school practices are now a model for the world. Germany, on the other hand, surprisingly underperformed; then it convened a conference of ministers and proposed urgent changes to improve its education system.4</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On the 2012 PISA, among the sixty-five participating countries and economies, US high school students ranked thirty-sixth for mathematics performance, with scores declining since 2009.5 In response to the poor performance on such assessments, the US secretary of education at the time, Arne Duncan, quipped, “We have to see this as a wake-up call. I know skeptics will want to argue with the results, but we consider them to be accurate and reliable. . . . We can quibble, or we can face the brutal truth that we’re being out-educated.”6</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Many explanations popped up around the topic in the US. Some suggested that the problem was the school system, whereas others pointed to socioeconomic factors (e.g., high rates of inequality and disadvantaged students), culture, or the way parents in the US raise their children.7 But no one stopped to ask, Can we really conclude from this test that US students’ academic ability is low? My colleagues John List, Jeffrey Livingston, Sally Sadoff, Xiangdong Qin, Yang Xu, and I explored an entirely different explanation: What if the students are just not trying as hard as students in other countries?8</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">See, test scores are based on two factors: the students’ ability and the effort they put into the test. The common interpretation is that the results reflect differences in ability; we suggest that they also reflect differences between countries in students’ effort level. If students in different countries have different levels of intrinsic motivation to perform well on the assessment test, the unmotivated students might be just as smart and capable, but their scores wouldn’t necessarily reflect that on a low-stakes test. If so, the poor US performance relative to other countries may be partially explained by a difference in effort exerted on the test itself, rather than differences in actual ability. In other words, Tyler and his friends may feel no motivation to do well on a test that they don’t care about, but that lack of concern doesn’t mean they’re not as smart and knowledgeable as their counterparts in China (who score among the top of the list) or Finland. It just means they’re not putting in as much effort on the test.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To investigate whether public policy makers were wrong in their diagnosis of the problem, we set up an experiment with incentives in high schools in both the US and Shanghai, China. We chose Shanghai specifically because it was ranked first in math on the 2012 PISA, whereas the US was ranked thirty-sixth on that same test. We conducted an abridged version of the official test, with twenty-five math questions collected from previous PISA tests, and gave students twenty-five minutes to solve them.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Our manipulation was simple: In the control groups, students were simply asked to answer as many questions as they could within the twenty-five-minute time frame. These control groups mimicked the conditions students faced on the actual PISA test, in that students had no external motivation to do well on the test. The game tree shown here represents the decision that students in the control groups faced. They could put in effort and get absolutely nothing extrinsic (Outcome #1 in the game tree), or they could take the test quickly and carelessly, without expending too much effort on it (Outcome #2).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When there’s no incentive to put effort into test</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Outcome #1 is no exaggeration in the US. Somewhere, somehow, someone thought teenagers would put in maximum effort on a test just for the heck of it. To reiterate, the students who are randomly selected to take the PISA test don’t even get their test results back. They don’t get the chance to feel proud or to be shamed into doing better. No one would tap Tyler’s shoulder a year later and say, “Hey, remember that test you took when you were fifteen? You did poorly, and now the US is ranked thirty-sixth. Thanks a lot, Tyler.” The fifteen-year-olds probably forgot about the test minutes after they took it and would probably never hear about it again. It should come as no surprise to any of us that many fifteen-year-olds in the US would go with Outcome #2. Reflecting on my fifteen-year-old self, I’m sure I would have.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">However, for our hypothesis to be validated and to demonstrate that the problem was effort and not ability, we needed something else. Again, public policy makers tend to attribute the difference in test scores to a difference in ability between the Shanghai and US students.9 Our hypothesis, on the other hand, was that Shanghai students are more likely to invest effort in low-stakes tests simply because they are asked to. Why? One reason could be that Chinese culture stresses effort, whereas US culture emphasizes innate ability. In China, the effort is additionally inspired by a sense of community and pride: students knowing that they’re representing their country’s academic ability on a test like the PISA motivates them to try harder in order to demonstrate their patriotism. The teachers might also underscore the significance of representing the country in such an exam and further encourage the students to try their hardest. This difference amounts to a cultural difference in attitudes, but we needed to show that in an experiment. To do so, we used—you guessed it—incentives. So, what did we offer the students to make them put in the effort that simply wasn’t there before?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Monday morning, 8 a.m. Lucas strolls into his tenth-grade class to see all thirty desks with two closed packets set on top of them. He’s midgroan when he notices a green edge peeking out from one of the packets. He rushes to his seat, and his suspicions are confirmed: the second packet is stuffed with twenty-five crisp $1 bills. His eyes widen. As soon as the rest of his class trickles in, Mr. Fitzgerald announces that their school has been randomly selected to take part in an experiment. The test has twenty-five questions, and for each question they answer incorrectly, $1 will be taken away. If they answer all twenty-five questions correctly, all $25 will be theirs to keep. Mr. Fitzgerald starts the clock. Let’s begin, Lucas thinks with a determined grin.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">That’s right—we offered them money. In the treatment groups, just as students were sitting down, they received $25 and were told that we would take away $1 for every question they didn’t answer correctly. (The Chinese students faced incentives of equivalent cash in Yuan.) With these incentives, we employed the psychological phenomenon of “loss aversion,” discussed in chapter 10. Physically having the money in your hands and potentially losing it is more painful than thinking about not receiving money that is intangible in the first place (i.e., thinking about being paid a couple of dollars less at some point in the future). Because of loss aversion, this incentive scheme is also more motivating than having the students gain $1 for every question that they answer correctly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">When incentive to put effort into test is added</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Our experimental design gave us four groups to compare: the US versus Shanghai students, each with or without incentives. Notably, we wanted to ensure that the incentives would influence only effort on the test itself and not preparation for the exam. To isolate effort, the treatment groups learned about the monetary incentive just before they took the test, so the only thing the students could do differently was try harder on the test itself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Now, our token high school US students faced two very different sets of incentives when making their decision. They could put in more effort and get up to $25 (Outcome #1 in the game tree above), or they could take the test quickly and carelessly and get very little money (Outcome #2).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The students now had strong motivation to put in effort, because they had the potential to earn money by doing so. Were the incentives large enough to make Outcome #1 more attractive than Outcome #2 in the game tree? Yes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The results confirmed our hypothesis: in response to the incentives, very little about the performance of the Shanghai students changed. Apparently, the Shanghai students were already trying as hard as they could without incentives, and the introduction of an additional incentive could not change that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The scores of the US students, however, rose dramatically. With the incentives, the US students tackled more questions and were more likely to answer those questions correctly. We estimate that if US students received incentives on the actual PISA test, the US would cut its ranking gap with Shanghai roughly in half, improving from the current thirty-sixth place to nineteenth place.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Billions of dollars are spent based on the assumption that standardized tests such as the PISA reveal true student ability and reflect the effectiveness of the way education systems are structured in different countries. The US policies influenced by these standardized tests assume that the ability of US students is lower than the ability of students in other countries. In reality, although the results of these tests are partly influenced by ability, they are also heavily influenced by intrinsic motivations and cultural differences in attitudes toward low-stakes tests. Using incentives exposed that it is indeed not all about ability.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The PISA experiment demonstrates the importance of identifying the problem correctly by using incentives as a diagnostic tool. Note that I am not suggesting here that we should pay students to work hard on tests; I just say that incentives for a small sample can help us diagnose the problem. The first stage in solving the problem is to correctly diagnose it, as is the case when visiting your doctor. Remember the joke about the guy who thought his wife was losing her hearing? Don’t simply assume you know what the source of the problem is; use experiments to test your intuition whenever and wherever you can.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">TAKEAWAY: The assumption that low-stake tests reflect only differences in students’ ability is rejected by the data. Public policy based on this assumption could be wasteful.</p>
